            Oppo recently launched the A5s in India at a price of Rs. 9,990, pitting it against some of 
            the best value-for-money smartphones in the market including the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review) 
            and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 (Review). The Oppo A5s is powered by the new MediaTek Helio P35 SoC along
             with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The smartphone also packs in a big 4230mAh battery that
              should help it outlast the competition. Is the Oppo A5s worth considering for its asking price
              , or should you take a look at alternatives? We put it to the test to find out.
